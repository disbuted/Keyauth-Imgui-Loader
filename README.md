# Keyauth-Imgui-Loader

---

I will NOT be giving any sort of support with this. If you do not know what to do, I suggest you go take some lessions. 

**uwuhook** — a clean, ImGui-based loader with a Pandora-inspired look.  
It’s simple, customizable, and made for developers who want a polished loader without building everything from scratch.

---

## What is uwuhook?
uwuhook actually started out as a side project for a PC cleaner / bypass tool.  
That idea was later scrapped, but instead of letting the code sit around, I decided to release the backend and UI here on GitHub.  

Now it’s just a nice base you can use (or learn from) if you want to build your own loader with ImGui.

`The working source code for the PC Cleaner / Trace cleaner can be purchased if you contact me :)`

## Features
- **DX11 ImGui backend** — smooth and modern interface.  
- **Freetype fonts** — crisp, clean text.  
- **KeyAuth support** — drop in your keys and product setup.  
- **Protections included**: *XOR, SkStr, lazy importer, obfusheader, VMProtectSDK* (swap or remove as you like).  
- Lightweight — runs at about *2% CPU usage* on my end.  
- Easy to customize: names, labels, update strings, colors, and more.

## Tech used
- **ImGui (DX11)** for the UI.  
- **Freetype** for better font rendering.  
- **KeyAuth** if you want licensing/auth integration.  
- Extra protections / Obfuscation: XOR, SkStr, lazy importer, obfusheader, VMProtectSDK.

---

## UI & Design
- Inspired by the CSGO cheat *Pandora*.  
- Dark, modern theme with accent colors.  
- Fonts, spacing, and colors are all easy to tweak.  
- Everything shown in the UI (names, labels, updates) can be changed quickly.

---

## Getting started
1. Clone the repo.  
2. Open the solution in **Visual Studio** (make sure you have the needed redist packages).  
3. Build and run to see the loader UI.  
4. Edit `main.cpp` and `main.hpp` to update labels, product names, and visuals.

uwuhook is meant as a simple base and learning project.  
Tweak it, change it, and make it your own.

Happy coding
